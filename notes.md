### Rules:
- Each `Main` file is **self-contained**
- Every program must compile and run
- One concept per file (clarity over cleverness)

If a new concept does not naturally fit an existing file, a new `Main` is created.  
This is intentional and encouraged.

## 🔁 Continuous Improvement Model

Code in this repo is **not static**.

Files may:
- Be refactored
- Be extended
- Be simplified
- Be revisited after learning new concepts

This reflects real-world development, where understanding improves incrementally.

---

## 📅 Daily Practice Loop

Typical learning cycle:
1. Learn one Java concept (video, docs, notes)
2. Implement a minimal working example
3. Improve or refactor existing code
4. Document the learning briefly (commit message / README update)

No artificial deadlines.  
No forced project scopes.

## 🚀 Long-Term Direction

Over time, this playground may naturally evolve into:
- Shared utilities
- Reusable components
- Backend services
- Infrastructure-aware Java applications

Any “project” that emerges will be **earned**, not forced. (from this off course!)

---

## 🧩 What This Repo Is NOT

- Not a polished portfolio
- Not a tutorial walkthrough
- Not a collection of copied examples

It is a **thinking space**.

## 📌 Final Note

This repository represents how I actually learn and grow as a developer:
- Calm
- Intentional
- Continuous

It is designed for **depth, relevance, and longevity**.
