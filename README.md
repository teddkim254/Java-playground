# Java Playground — Snippet-Driven Learning Lab

This repository is my **Java learning laboratory**.

Instead of chasing many small “projects” or restarting one big project over and over, 
this repo is designed for **continuous, snippet-driven learning** 
that mirrors how real engineers build fluency over time.

The goal is not to finish projects —  
the goal is to **become comfortable, precise, and confident in Java**.

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

Most Java concepts are:
- Small
- Orthogonal
- Best learned in isolation first

Forcing every concept into its own project adds unnecessary complexity.  
Forcing everything into one big project too early creates confusion.

This repo follows a **middle path**:
- Focused experiments
- Evolving programs
- Clean mental models

This is how real backend codebases actually grow.

## 🎯 Why This Strategy Works (for me)

- I learn best by **understanding mechanisms**, not by copying structures
- I want **long-term fluency**, not short-term “project completion”
- I’m focused on **backend, systems, and infrastructure-aware development**
- I prefer improving existing code rather than constantly restarting
- I found Java and other backend languages complex enough to make me **overwhelmed**

This approach allows:
- Deep understanding of individual concepts
- Natural connections between features over time
- Freedom to explore without breaking momentum
- Less overwhelm

## 🧪 How the Code Is Organized

The repository is organized as a **playground**, not a product.

Each package(folder) contains a `Main` class focused on **one core idea**: soon!
